  <h1>Hotter, Colder Documentation</h1>
  
  <h2>Project Outline</h2>
  <p>This project consists of a web application, built using p5.js, Tone.js, and p5.Play. This web application uses physical input from an Ardunio UNO unit with an Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to sense user input, and can respond to input with sound generated by Tone.js and a flickering green LED wired through the UNO unit.</p>
  
  <h2>Narrative Description</h2>
  <p>This project is a game, titled <i>Hotter, Colder</i>, in which the player will begin by using the mouse click to enter the game state. From that point they will be prompted to connect to the Arduino unit through an on-screen button. After connecting, the player must use the input from the Ultrasonic Distance Sensor to prevent the wave on-screen from sinking to the bottom. Additionally in order to win the game, the player must raise the water level to an unknown value before time runs out. This gameplay is accompanied with music provided from Tone.js that increasingly speeds up as the player takes more time. Upon a victory, the player will be rewarded with the flash of the green LED as well as a winning chime playing from the application(Tone.js).</p>

  <h2>Future Development Plans</h2>
  <p>Some future development plans for this project include altering the background music from an instrumental sample from <i>Hot In Herre</i> by Nelly, to being an originally composed piece for this game. Additional plans include changing the goal from just meeting the desired target level once to having to hold it there for a number of seconds in order to progress, multiple levels of increasing difficulty where the target window narrows and the timer begins at a lower time, and restylizing the connection button/prompt with css elements to make for a smoother transition from physical computing input to gameplay as well as making the connection more in line with the established aesthetic of the game. Finally, I would like to animate the wave so it would grow hotter in hue as it neared the target value and colder the further you were away from it.</p>
